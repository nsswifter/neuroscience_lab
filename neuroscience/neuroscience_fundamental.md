# Understanding Key Concepts in Neuroscience

## Structure of the Nervous System
- **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: Includes the brain and spinal cord.
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: Consists of nerves outside the CNS, subdivided into:
  - **Somatic Nervous System**: Controls voluntary movements (skeletal muscles).
  - **Autonomic Nervous System**: Manages involuntary functions, divided into:
    - **Sympathetic System** (fight-or-flight response).
    - **Parasympathetic System** (rest and digest functions).

## Neurons and Glial Cells
The brain's two primary cell types are **neurons** and **glial cells**:
- **Neurons**: Transmit electrical and chemical signals.
- **Glial Cells**: Support neurons by providing structural integrity, insulation, and maintaining homeostasis. Key glial types include **astrocytes**, **oligodendrocytes**, and **microglia**.

## Neuron Structure
- **Dendrites**: Receive incoming signals.
- **Cell Body (Soma)**: Contains the nucleus and vital organelles.
- **Axon**: Sends electrical impulses away from the cell body.
- **Axon Terminal**: Releases neurotransmitters to communicate with other neurons or muscle cells.

## Myelin
**Myelin** is a fatty sheath produced by:
- **Oligodendrocytes** in the CNS.
- **Schwann Cells** in the PNS.

Myelin wraps around axons to enhance the speed of signal transmission.

## Types of Neurons
Neurons can be categorized by **function**:
- **Sensory Neurons**: Relay signals from sensory receptors to the CNS.
- **Motor Neurons**: Transmit commands from the CNS to muscles/glands.
- **Interneurons**: Connect neurons within the CNS for integration of information.

They can also be classified by **structure**:
- **Unipolar**: Single process from the cell body.
- **Bipolar**: Two processes (one axon, one dendrite).
- **Multipolar**: Multiple processes, typically one axon and several dendrites.
- **Anaxonic**: No identifiable axon.

Neurons can also be grouped based on their neurotransmitter release, such as:
- **Cholinergic** (acetylcholine), **dopaminergic**, **glutamatergic**, and **GABAergic** neurons.

## Ion Channels and Membrane Potential

### Resting Membrane Potential (RMP)
- Resting potential is around **-70 mV**.
- Created by:
  - High **K⁺** concentration inside the neuron.
  - High **Na⁺** concentration outside the neuron.
- Maintained by the **Sodium-Potassium Pump**, which moves **3 Na⁺ out** and **2 K⁺ in** using ATP.

### Action Potential (AP) Steps
1. **Resting State**: The neuron is at -70 mV.
2. **Depolarization**: 
   - **Na⁺ channels open**, and Na⁺ enters the neuron, causing the membrane potential to become positive.
3. **Repolarization**:
   - **Na⁺ channels close**, and **K⁺ channels open**.
   - **K⁺ exits**, returning the membrane to a negative state.
4. **Hyperpolarization**: 
   - K⁺ continues to exit, dropping the potential below -70 mV.
5. **Restoration**: The **sodium-potassium pump** reestablishes the original ion distribution.

### Sodium-Potassium Pump
- Uses ATP to pump **3 Na⁺ out** and **2 K⁺ in** per cycle.
- Restores resting potential after an action potential.

## Synaptic Transmission
1. **Action Potential Arrival**: Triggers the opening of **voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels** at the axon terminal.
2. **Calcium Influx**: **Ca²⁺ ions** enter the neuron.
3. **Vesicle Fusion**: **Synaptic vesicles** containing neurotransmitters fuse with the membrane.
4. **Neurotransmitter Release**: Neurotransmitters cross the **synaptic cleft** and bind to receptors on the **postsynaptic neuron**, leading to excitatory or inhibitory effects.

## Neurotransmitters & Synaptic Activity
- **Acetylcholine (ACh)**: Muscle contraction and autonomic functions.
- **Dopamine**: Reward system and movement regulation.
- **Serotonin**: Mood, sleep, and appetite regulation.
- **Glutamate**: Major excitatory neurotransmitter.
- **GABA**: Major inhibitory neurotransmitter.

## Summary of Ion Movements in Neurons
- **At Rest**: 
  - **K⁺ inside**, **Na⁺ outside**.
  - The **sodium-potassium pump** maintains the gradient.
- **During Action Potential**:
  - **Na⁺ enters** (depolarization).
  - **K⁺ exits** (repolarization).
- **After Action Potential**:
  - The **sodium-potassium pump** restores the balance.

## White Matter vs. Gray Matter
The CNS is made up of:
- **White Matter**: Contains **myelinated axons** and is responsible for fast communication between brain regions.
- **Gray Matter**: Composed of **neuronal cell bodies**, dendrites, and synapses, primarily responsible for information processing.

| **Region**                      | **Neurons**           | **Glial Cells**          |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **White Matter (Brain)**         | < 1%                  | ~99% (mostly oligodendrocytes) |
| **Gray Matter (Brain)**          | ~40%                  | ~60%                     |
| **White Matter (Spinal Cord)**   | < 1%                  | ~99%                     |
| **Gray Matter (Spinal Cord)**    | ~20-30%               | ~70-80%                  |

## Reflex Arc
- **Reflexes**: Involuntary, quick responses to stimuli.
- Components of the **Reflex Arc**:
  1. **Receptor**: Detects stimulus.
  2. **Sensory Neuron**: Transmits signal to the spinal cord.
  3. **Integration Center**: Processes signal (usually in the spinal cord).
  4. **Motor Neuron**: Sends response to muscles.
  5. **Effector**: Carries out the response (e.g., muscle contraction).

### Types of Reflexes
- **Monosynaptic Reflex**: Single synapse (e.g., **knee-jerk reflex**).
- **Polysynaptic Reflex**: Multiple synapses (e.g., **withdrawal reflex**).

## Memory and Neurons
Memory involves **synaptic plasticity**, where the strength of connections between neurons changes based on their activity:
- **Short-term memory** relies on temporary changes.
- **Long-term memory** involves structural changes in synapses.

Glial cells also play a role in memory formation by regulating synaptic activity.

## Rest and Brain Function
Taking breaks every **20 to 40 minutes** during intense learning helps **refresh cognitive function**. During rest, the **default mode network (DMN)** becomes active, promoting memory consolidation and creative thinking.
