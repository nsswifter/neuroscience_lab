# Understanding Key Concepts in Neuroscience

## Neurons and Glial Cells
The brain's fundamental units are `neurons` and `glial cells`. Neurons are responsible for transmitting information, while glial cells provide structural support, insulation, and help maintain homeostasis. Neurons communicate using electrical and chemical signals, and glial cells, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, play essential roles in supporting neuronal function.

## Myelin
`Myelin`, while not a cell itself, is a substance formed by **oligodendrocytes** in the central nervous system (CNS) and **Schwann cells** in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). It wraps around the axons of neurons to create a protective sheath that increases the speed of electrical signal transmission.

## White Matter vs. Gray Matter
The `central nervous system (CNS)` is divided into two main types of tissue: `white matter` and `gray matter`.
The **white matter** in the brain and spinal cord is composed mainly of **myelinated axons**, which facilitate the fast transmission of signals between different brain regions and between the brain and the spinal cord. The **gray matter**, on the other hand, consists of **neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses**, which are primarily responsible for processing information.

In terms of glial and neuronal composition, **gray matter** has a higher density of neurons involved in processing, while **white matter** contains more glial cells that assist in maintaining myelin and aiding communication.

| **Region**                      | **Neurons**           | **Glial Cells**          |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **White Matter (Brain)**         | < 1%                  | ~99% (mostly oligodendrocytes) |
| **Gray Matter (Brain)**          | ~40%                  | ~60%                     |
| **White Matter (Spinal Cord)**   | < 1%                  | ~99%                     |
| **Gray Matter (Spinal Cord)**    | ~20-30%               | ~70-80%                  |

## Memory and Neurons
Memory storage in the brain occurs through changes in synaptic connections between neurons, a process known as **synaptic plasticity**. When we learn something new, neurons form stronger or weaker connections with each other, depending on how frequently they communicate. This strengthening or weakening of synapses helps to encode and store memory. 

Memory is often broken down into **short-term memory**, which lasts for a few seconds to minutes and relies on temporary changes in neurons, and **long-term memory**, which involves structural changes to synapses, making memories more permanent.

In addition to neurons, **glial cells** are increasingly recognized for their role in memory formation, particularly in how they regulate synaptic activity and neuronal communication.

## Rest and Brain Function
Taking breaks every **20 to 40 minutes** during intense mental tasks helps **refresh cognitive function** by allowing the brain to consolidate information and prepare for new learning. During rest, regions like the **default mode network (DMN)**, which includes the medial prefrontal cortex, become active. The DMN is involved in self-reflection, memory consolidation, and creative thinking. This downtime enables the brain to integrate new information, making it critical for effective learning and problem-solving.

## Types of Neurons
Neurons can be classified in various ways. Based on **function**, neurons include:
- **Sensory neurons**, which carry signals from sensory receptors to the CNS.
- **Motor neurons**, which transmit commands from the CNS to muscles and glands.
- **Interneurons**, which connect neurons within the CNS and integrate information.

Based on **structure**, neurons are:
- **Unipolar** (one process extends from the cell body).
- **Bipolar** (two processes).
- **Multipolar** (many processes, with one axon and multiple dendrites).
- **Anaxonic** (no identifiable axon).

Neurons are also classified by the type of **neurotransmitter** they release, such as **cholinergic**, **dopaminergic**, **glutamatergic**, and **GABAergic** neurons.
